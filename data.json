            "What is a recurrent neural network?",
            "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for sequential data such as text or time series data. It uses loops to allow information to persist from one step to the next and can learn long-term dependencies in the data."
        ],
        [
            "What is a loss function?",
            "A loss function is a function that measures how well a machine learning model is performing on a task. It is used during training to guide the model towards better performance by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss."
        ],
        [
            "What is the greenhouse effect?",
            "The greenhouse effect is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat from the sun, causing the Earth's surface to warm up. This effect helps to regulate the Earth's temperature and make it habitable, but human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are causing an increase in the concentration of these gases and an enhanced greenhouse effect, which is leading to global warming."

        [
            "What is DNA?",
            "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms. It consists of a sequence of nucleotides that form a double helix, which is the structure of the DNA molecule. The sequence of nucleotides determines the genetic code, which is used to direct the synthesis of proteins and other important molecules in the cell."

            "What is the scientific method?",
            "The scientific method is a systematic approach to solving problems and answering questions in science. It involves several steps, including formulating a hypothesis, designing experiments to test the hypothesis, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions based on the results."
        ],
        [
            "What is the difference between a hypothesis and a theory?",
            "A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for a phenomenon that can be tested through experimentation or observation. A theory, on the other hand, is a well-established explanation for a phenomenon that has been supported by a large body of evidence and has been validated by multiple experiments and observations."
